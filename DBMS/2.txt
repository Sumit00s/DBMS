Step 1: Database and Table Creation
sql
Copy code
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE company_data;

-- Use the database
USE company_data;

-- Create the employee table
CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    street VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create the works table
CREATE TABLE works (
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    company_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name)
);

-- Create the company table
CREATE TABLE company (
    company_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create the manages table
CREATE TABLE manages (
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_name VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name)
);
Step 2: Inserting Sample Data
sql
Copy code
-- Insert data into employee table
INSERT INTO employee (employee_name, street, city) VALUES
('Alice', '123 Maple St', 'New York'),
('Bob', '456 Oak St', 'Los Angeles'),
('Charlie', '789 Pine St', 'Chicago'),
('David', '101 Birch St', 'New York'),
('Eve', '202 Cedar St', 'Chicago');

-- Insert data into works table
INSERT INTO works (employee_name, company_name, salary) VALUES
('Alice', 'First Bank Corporation', 12000),
('Bob', 'Small Bank Corporation', 9000),
('Charlie', 'First Bank Corporation', 10500),
('David', 'Tech Solutions', 11500),
('Eve', 'Small Bank Corporation', 13000);

-- Insert data into company table
INSERT INTO company (company_name, city) VALUES
('First Bank Corporation', 'New York'),
('Small Bank Corporation', 'Chicago'),
('Tech Solutions', 'San Francisco');

-- Insert data into manages table
INSERT INTO manages (employee_name, manager_name) VALUES
('Alice', 'Bob'),
('Charlie', 'Alice'),
('David', 'Eve');
