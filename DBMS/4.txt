4.The following tables form part of a database held in a relational DBMS:
Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) HotelNo is primary key
Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price)
Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo)
Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) GuestNo is primary key
Solve following queries by SQL
1. What is the total revenue per night from all double rooms?
2. List the details of all rooms at the Grosvenor Hotel, including the name of
the guest staying in the room, if the room is occupied.
3. What is the average number of bookings for each hotel in April?
4. Create index on one of the field and show is performance in query.
5. List full details of all hotels.
6. List full details of all hotels in London.
7. Update the price of all rooms by 5%.
8. List the number of rooms in each hotel in London.
9. List all double or family rooms with a price below £40.00 per night, in
ascending order of price.


Here’s the SQL code to create the tables:

sql
Copy code
-- Create the Hotel table
CREATE TABLE Hotel (
    HotelNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the Room table
CREATE TABLE Room (
    RoomNo INT,
    HotelNo INT,
    Type VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (RoomNo, HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (HotelNo) REFERENCES Hotel(HotelNo)
);

-- Create the Guest table
CREATE TABLE Guest (
    GuestNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    GuestName VARCHAR(100),
    GuestAddress VARCHAR(200)
);

-- Create the Booking table
CREATE TABLE Booking (
    HotelNo INT,
    GuestNo INT,
    DateFrom DATE,
    DateTo DATE,
    RoomNo INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom),
    FOREIGN KEY (HotelNo) REFERENCES Hotel(HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (RoomNo, HotelNo) REFERENCES Room(RoomNo, HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (GuestNo) REFERENCES Guest(GuestNo)
);
Step 2: Insert Sample Data
Now, let's insert sample data into these tables:

sql
Copy code
-- Insert data into Hotel
INSERT INTO Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) VALUES
(1, 'Grosvenor Hotel', 'London'),
(2, 'Sunset Inn', 'Paris'),
(3, 'Mountain View', 'New York');

-- Insert data into Room
INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES
(101, 1, 'Single', 50.00),
(102, 1, 'Double', 80.00),
(103, 1, 'Family', 100.00),
(104, 2, 'Single', 45.00),
(105, 2, 'Double', 75.00),
(106, 3, 'Double', 90.00),
(107, 3, 'Family', 120.00);

-- Insert data into Guest
INSERT INTO Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '123 Elm St, London'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '456 Oak St, Paris'),
(3, 'Alice Johnson', '789 Pine St, New York'),
(4, 'Bob Brown', '321 Maple St, London');

-- Insert data into Booking
INSERT INTO Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo) VALUES
(1, 1, '2024-04-01', '2024-04-03', 102),
(1, 2, '2024-04-05', '2024-04-07', 103),
(2, 3, '2024-04-01', '2024-04-03', 104),
(3, 4, '2024-04-10', '2024-04-12', 107);
Step 3: Solve the Queries
What is the total revenue per night from all double rooms?

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Room
WHERE Type = 'Double';
List the details of all rooms at the Grosvenor Hotel, including the name of the guest staying in the room, if the room is occupied.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Room.RoomNo, Room.Type, Room.Price, Guest.GuestName
FROM Room
LEFT JOIN Booking ON Room.RoomNo = Booking.RoomNo AND Room.HotelNo = Booking.HotelNo
LEFT JOIN Guest ON Booking.GuestNo = Guest.GuestNo
JOIN Hotel ON Room.HotelNo = Hotel.HotelNo
WHERE Hotel.Name = 'Grosvenor Hotel';
What is the average number of bookings for each hotel in April?

sql
Copy code
SELECT HotelNo, COUNT(*) / 30.0 AS AvgBookingsInApril
FROM Booking
WHERE MONTH(DateFrom) = 4
GROUP BY HotelNo;
Create index on one of the fields and show its performance in a query.

Let's create an index on the Price field in the Room table and then run a query to check its performance.

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_room_price ON Room(Price);

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Room WHERE Price < 50;
List full details of all hotels.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Hotel;
List full details of all hotels in London.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Hotel
WHERE City = 'London';
Update the price of all rooms by 5%.

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Room
SET Price = Price * 1.05;
List the number of rooms in each hotel in London.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Hotel.Name, COUNT(Room.RoomNo) AS NumberOfRooms
FROM Hotel
JOIN Room ON Hotel.HotelNo = Room.HotelNo
WHERE Hotel.City = 'London'
GROUP BY Hotel.HotelNo, Hotel.Name;
List all double or family rooms with a price below £40.00 per night, in ascending order of price.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * 
FROM Room 
WHERE Type IN ('Double', 'Family') AND Price < 40 
ORDER BY Price ASC;
