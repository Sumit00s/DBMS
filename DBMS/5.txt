5. The following tables form part of a database held in a relational DBMS:
Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) HotelNo is the primary key
Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price)
Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo)
Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress)
Solve following queries by SQL
1. List full details of all hotels.
2. How many hotels are there?
3. List the price and type of all rooms at the Grosvenor Hotel.
4. List the number of rooms in each hotel
5. List all guests currently staying at the Grosvenor Hotel.
6. List all double or family rooms with a price below £40.00 per night, in ascending order of
price.
7. How many different guests have made bookings for August?
8. What is the total income from bookings for the Grosvenor Hotel today?
9. What is the most commonly booked room type for each hotel in London?
10. Update the price of all rooms by 5%.


Step 1: Create the Database and Tables
Assuming the same schema as before, we proceed by creating the tables.

sql
Copy code
-- Create the Hotel table
CREATE TABLE Hotel (
    HotelNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the Room table
CREATE TABLE Room (
    RoomNo INT,
    HotelNo INT,
    Type VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (RoomNo, HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (HotelNo) REFERENCES Hotel(HotelNo)
);

-- Create the Guest table
CREATE TABLE Guest (
    GuestNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    GuestName VARCHAR(100),
    GuestAddress VARCHAR(200)
);

-- Create the Booking table
CREATE TABLE Booking (
    HotelNo INT,
    GuestNo INT,
    DateFrom DATE,
    DateTo DATE,
    RoomNo INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom),
    FOREIGN KEY (HotelNo) REFERENCES Hotel(HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (RoomNo, HotelNo) REFERENCES Room(RoomNo, HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (GuestNo) REFERENCES Guest(GuestNo)
);
Step 2: Insert Sample Data for Queries
Now, I'll insert the data relevant to your queries, ensuring that they will return meaningful results when executed.

sql
Copy code
-- Insert data into Hotel
INSERT INTO Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) VALUES
(1, 'Grosvenor Hotel', 'London'),
(2, 'Sunset Inn', 'Paris'),
(3, 'Mountain View', 'New York');

-- Insert data into Room
INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES
(101, 1, 'Single', 50.00),
(102, 1, 'Double', 80.00),
(103, 1, 'Family', 100.00),
(104, 2, 'Single', 45.00),
(105, 2, 'Double', 75.00),
(106, 3, 'Double', 90.00),
(107, 3, 'Family', 120.00),
(108, 1, 'Double', 85.00), -- Additional room in Grosvenor
(109, 2, 'Family', 110.00); -- Additional room in Sunset Inn

-- Insert data into Guest
INSERT INTO Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '123 Elm St, London'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '456 Oak St, Paris'),
(3, 'Alice Johnson', '789 Pine St, New York'),
(4, 'Bob Brown', '321 Maple St, London'),
(5, 'Tom Harris', '432 Birch St, London'),
(6, 'Lucy Green', '654 Cedar St, London'), -- Additional guest for varied bookings
(7, 'Sam White', '987 Willow St, Paris'); -- Another guest for diverse data

-- Insert data into Booking (to ensure meaningful results for queries)
INSERT INTO Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo) VALUES
(1, 1, '2024-08-01', '2024-08-03', 102), -- Grosvenor Hotel
(1, 2, '2024-08-05', '2024-08-07', 103), -- Grosvenor Hotel
(2, 3, '2024-08-01', '2024-08-03', 104), -- Sunset Inn
(3, 4, '2024-08-10', '2024-08-12', 107), -- Mountain View
(1, 5, '2024-08-15', '2024-08-17', 102), -- Grosvenor Hotel
(2, 6, '2024-08-05', '2024-08-08', 109), -- Sunset Inn (family room)
(1, 7, '2024-08-01', '2024-08-05', 108); -- Grosvenor Hotel (additional booking)
Step 3: Execute the Queries
